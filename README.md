##  About Me

As a passionate and driven MSc Data Science graduate, I strive to uncover patterns and insights from complex datasets to solve real-world problems. I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful outcomes through machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

My academic journey and hands-on projects—such as a deep learning-based bone fracture classification model—have equipped me with a solid foundation in AI, data engineering, and analytics. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and building data-driven solutions that make an impact.

##  Featured Projects

###  Bone Fracture Classification using CNNs  
A deep learning model to automatically detect and classify types of bone fractures from X-ray images.  
*Technologies:* Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN  
🔗 [GitHub Repository](#) https://github.com/ShyamDodway/Bone-fracture-Classification

### YouTube-Video-Question-Answering-with-RAG-LLM
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that lets users ask questions about any YouTube video.
The app extracts the video transcript, stores it in a vector database (FAISS), and answers user queries with context-aware responses using OpenAI.
