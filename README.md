## 🌟 About Me

As a passionate and driven MSc Data Science graduate, I strive to uncover patterns and insights from complex datasets to solve real-world problems. I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful outcomes through machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

My academic journey and hands-on projects—such as a deep learning-based bone fracture classification model—have equipped me with a solid foundation in AI, data engineering, and analytics. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and building data-driven solutions that make an impact.
